goal: present string based techniques to identify cognates between English and German

method:
* use simple string methods described in: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I11-1097.pdf

- Edit distance.
- Length of longest common prefix.
- Number of common bigrams.
- Lengths of individual words.
- Absolute difference between the lengths of the words.
